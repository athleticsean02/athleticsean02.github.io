      <h3>How is Social Justice related to the HIV/AIDs epidemic? </h3>
	
	
	<p>Some population groups, in particular African Americans, continue to be disproportionately affected by HIV. African Americans have the highest rates of HIV and are more likely to die from HIV/AIDS than any other race or ethnicity. Environmental factors, such as housing conditions, social networks, and social support are key drivers of HIV, and discrimination and racism worsen the disparate impact of HIV on African Americans. These factors help shape a context of vulnerability that either contributes to increased individual risk of exposure to HIV or compromises the ability to protect oneself from infection. HIV disparities have more to do with the systematic realities of health care and society than individual or group behaviors.According to AIDSVu there are approximately over 35,402 people in Atlanta living with HIV.African americans make up 53.5 percent of the metro Atlanta area and approximately 67.9 percent of African american HIV cases are from male-to-male sexual contact.</p>
